# CUDA/GPU parallel computing
Implementation of basic genetic-like algorithm for parallel computing using CUDA/C++. Finding best weights and biases of neural network that plays snake game.  
! I could not use structures like queue,vectors etc. because CUDA is not compatible with it, so I had to operate on basic arrays and implement many functions myself.
